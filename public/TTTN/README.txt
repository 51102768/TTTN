- Export your first test into this directory using Inka3D HTML Exporter because
	the exported WebGL scenes need the files in the js directory.
- Try to drag/drop the exported .html file into your browser. If this is not supported
	by your browser then do the following:
	- Run StartServer from Explorer/Finder.
	- Open browser and go to the url displayed by the server
		(http://localhost or http://localhost:8080)
	- Check that the server displays the directory that your exported .html and .js
		files are in.
